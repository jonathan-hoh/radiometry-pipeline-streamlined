## Presentation Structure

### 1. Problem Statement & Value Proposition (3 minutes)
**Key Message**: Star tracker development is expensive and risky without accurate simulation

**Engineering Context**:
- Traditional approach: Build → Test → Fix → Repeat (costly cycle)
- Simulation approach: Predict → Optimize → Build right the first time

### 2. Technical Capabilities Overview (4 minutes)
