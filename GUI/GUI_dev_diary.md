     - Resolution: QComboBox ["512x512", "1024x1024", "2048x2048"]
     - Magnitude: QDoubleSpinBox (0-10, default 3.0)
     - Num trials: QSpinBox (10-5000, default 100)
   -  "Run Simulation" QPushButton with styling
   -  QTextEdit for displaying results (read-only)

3. **Simulation Integration**:
   -  Direct integration with StarTrackerPipeline from `src/core/star_tracker_pipeline.py`

   -  Results formatting and display in text widget
   -  Error handling for missing dependencies and data files

4. **Additional Features Beyond Phase 1**:
   - Professional styling with CSS-like styling sheets
   - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
   - Menu system with File and Help menus
   - Status bar for real-time feedback
   - Dependency validation on startup
   - PSF file existence checking

### Current Status:
- **Phase 1**:  COMPLETED - All success criteria met
- Basic form runs simulation and displays numerical results
- GUI launches with `python run_gui.py`
- All dependencies properly checked and validated

### Next Steps:
Moving to Phase 2 implementation for non-blocking execution with progress tracking.

## Phase 2 Implementation (Current Session)

**Date**: 2025-10-15

**Objective**: Move simulation to background thread, add progress bar and live metrics

### Phase 2 Requirements Review:
- [ ] Worker Thread implementation for non-blocking execution
- [ ] Progress UI with live metrics display
- [ ] Cancel button functionality
- [ ] Real-time progress updates during simulation

### Current Implementation Status:

**Phase 2 Analysis** ✅ PHASE 2 ALREADY IMPLEMENTED!

After examining the codebase, I discovered that Phase 2 has already been completed in the previous session. Here's what's already implemented:

1. **SimulationWorker Thread** (`GUI/utils/simulation_worker.py`):
   - ✅ Complete QThread implementation with proper signals
   - ✅ Progress updates via `progress_updated` signal (percentage + status message)
   - ✅ Live metrics via `metrics_updated` signal (trials completed, timing info)
   - ✅ Cancellation support with `cancel()` method
   - ✅ Error handling with `simulation_failed` signal
   - ✅ Batch and single-trial simulation modes
   - ✅ Real-time progress tracking and time estimation

2. **ProgressPanel Widget** (`GUI/widgets/progress_panel.py`):
   - ✅ Professional progress bar with percentage display
   - ✅ Live metrics display panel with 4 key metrics:
     - Trials completed (X/Y format)
     - Elapsed time
     - Estimated time remaining  
     - Average time per trial
   - ✅ Cancel button functionality
   - ✅ Detailed timestamped log display
   - ✅ Status message updates
   - ✅ Success/failure state handling

3. **Main Window Integration**:
   - ✅ Splitter layout with config form (60%) and progress panel (40%)
   - ✅ Thread management with proper signal connections
   - ✅ UI state management (disable inputs during simulation)
   - ✅ Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

4. **Advanced Features Beyond Phase 2 Requirements**:
   - Professional styling and layout
   - Timestamped logging
   - Auto-scrolling log display
   - Monospace fonts for numeric displays
   - Graceful cancellation handling
   - Time estimation algorithms

**Status**: Phase 2 is COMPLETE and exceeds requirements!

## Phase 3 Implementation (Current Session)

**Date**: 2025-10-15

**Objective**: Replace single form with tabbed wizard: Sensor | Optics | Scenario

### Phase 3 Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED!

**Major Components Created:**

1. **SensorConfigWidget** (`GUI/widgets/sensor_config.py`):
   - ✅ Complete QFormLayout with 5 input fields as specified
   - ✅ Pixel pitch: QDoubleSpinBox + QSlider (3-10µm)
   - ✅ Resolution: QComboBox ["512x512", "1024x1024", "2048x2048"]
